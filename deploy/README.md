# Fetching the latest code
Ideally, you should be reading this in a forked repo from bywatersolutions/aspen-lida.  You can pull the latest code in a few ways:
 - Through the GitHub UI
 - using the provided workflow, upstream-sync
   - run manually in GitHub Actions
   - scheduled (default is Feb 1st at midnight UTC, but you can make that more frequent)

# Triggering a Build
Builds can be run manually, but are automatically triggered whenever changes to build.json are found on the main/master branch.

**Important Note**: while it is possible to submit multiple builds with the same version BEFORE publication, once an app has been published within the store, further builds will need an incremented version number (found in `/version.json`) to be accepted.
